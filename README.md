## Technologies Used

- React: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React Router: Used to implement client-side routing and navigation within the application.

- ThemeContext: Utilized to manage and toggle between light and dark themes throughout the app.

- Google Books API: Integrated to fetch book data based on user search queries.

## Approach

The Bookshelf+ app was developed with the goal of providing users with a seamless experience to discover and manage their reading materials. Here's an overview of the approach taken:

1. **User Authentication**: The app allows users to register and log in. Users' credentials are stored in the local state for simplicity, but in a production-ready app, you would use a backend server to handle user authentication and store user data securely.

2. **Search for Books**: Users can search for books using the integrated Google Books API. As they type in the search bar, the app dynamically fetches book results and displays them.

3. **Reading List**: Once logged in, users can add books they are interested in to their reading list. The reading list is personalized for each user and stored in the local state for demonstration purposes.

4. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and work well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

5. **Themes**: Bookshelf+ offers both light and dark themes. Users can switch between the two themes using the ThemeToggle component located in the top-right corner of the app.

## Future Enhancements

While Bookshelf+ provides basic book searching and reading list features, there are several ways to expand and enhance the app in the future:

- **Backend Integration**: Implement a backend server to manage user authentication, store reading lists securely, and enable user data persistence.

- **User Profiles**: Enhance user profiles to include more information about each user, such as their favorite genres, reading habits, and more.

- **Social Features**: Allow users to share their reading lists and book recommendations with friends, and add social interactions to foster a community of book lovers.

- **Personalization**: Use machine learning algorithms to offer personalized book recommendations based on a user's reading history and preferences.

- **Book Details**: Display more comprehensive book details, including book ratings, reviews, and related titles.
